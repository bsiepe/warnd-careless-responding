## File structure


### `\data\`
Contains the data used for this project. As described in the manuscript, data used for this project wil be made available once all data collection is finished and all data are cleaned and anonymized. 


### `\scripts\`

All Quarto files are available as source code (`.qmd`) and as a rendered version (`.html`)

### `\figures\`

Contains all figures used in the manuscript and in the supplementary code. 

### `\renv\`
Alongside `renv.lock`, this contains files generated by the [`renv` package](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.renv) to create a reproducible package environment. 
Session informations are included in the different quarto files.
